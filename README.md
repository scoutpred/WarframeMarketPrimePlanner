# WarframeMarketPrimePlanner

Google Apps Script for Checking Prices and Ducat Values, with some features.

This is the spreadsheet I use: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sXHC3cX_bVHupqXUvV8mUlxRdJLJ1st2jSMRtCi5IVY/edit?usp=sharing

Fetches Prices and Ducat Values of Prime parts. API taken from Warframe.Market. Features are the following:

-Checks Seller Lowest Prices

-Checks Buyer Highest Prices

-Checks Ducat Value

-Ducat to Plat Ratio, good for determining if one should be sold as ducats or plat. Lower makes it good to sell for platinum.

-Automated calculations.

Future Features include

-Faster fetching of data, especially those in bulk.

-Some QoL. Could use your suggestions or just fork it out. Be sure to credit me on that. That's all I ask for! :)

That's about it. This is a hobby project made in times of my unemployment to improve my portfolio.
